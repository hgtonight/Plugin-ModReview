Mod Review
==========
A Vanilla Forums plugin in that adds a quick link for mods that marks a
discussion/comment as reviewed. This helps communication amongst your
mod team by letting them quickly see if a controversial post has been
reviewed by a member of the moderator team.

Once reviewed, the item receives a CSS class that denotes the item as
being reviewed. If another mod wants to discuss the merits of that
particular post, they can click on the review link to send a message to
the moderator that initially reviewed it.

It is released under the GPLv3 and may be released under a different license with permission.
